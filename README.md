# SHAT

A simple chat tool with a server and a client.
My goal is to create a chat where the users don't need to register in my application, the only thing to do is to enter a unique username and start chatting anonymity.

******

## Tasks

* Send and receive message from the different user
* List all the users

******

## TODO

* Improve the connection between two clients
  * delete connection
  * improve the chat aesthetic
  * control what happen when another client try to access
  * pay attention to other argument, maybe the quit one could cause some error. Maybe is better deactivate before quitting
* Don't allow name with whitespace character
